    <h2 class="text-center">Building a Symptom-Based Diagnosis App with Flask & Machine Learning</h2>

    <p>In todayâ€™s digital era, accessible and intelligent healthcare tools are more important than ever. With the growing need for remote medical support, I developed a Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web Application that leverages machine learning and Flask to help users identify potential health concerns based on the symptoms they report.</p>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>When people experience symptoms, they often seek immediate answers. However, symptom overlap between diseases makes self-diagnosis confusing. Our objective was to simplify this process by offering a platform where users could input symptoms and receive accurate disease predictions in real time.</p>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p>The solution was a web app that accepts symptoms and returns a likely diagnosis using a trained machine learning model. Here's how it works:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Symptom Entry:</strong> Users input symptoms through an intuitive form. The system recognizes a wide range of symptoms.</li>
      <li><strong>Model Prediction:</strong> A pre-trained Decision Tree Classifier evaluates the symptoms and predicts the most probable disease.</li>
      <li><strong>Immediate Feedback:</strong> Users instantly receive results, making the process fast and accessible.</li>
      <li><strong>Additional Insights:</strong> The app also provides a description of the disease, precautions, suggested medications, dietary tips, and recommended workouts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple UI:</strong> Clean and user-friendly design thatâ€™s easy to navigate.</li>
      <li><strong>AI-Powered Diagnosis:</strong> Uses machine learning for symptom-based disease prediction.</li>
      <li><strong>Comprehensive Support:</strong> Goes beyond diagnosis with additional health information like precautions, medicine, diet, and workouts.</li>
      <li><strong>Educational Content:</strong> Offers informative content to enhance health awareness and understanding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This project is a step toward smarter, more accessible healthcare. By combining artificial intelligence with medical knowledge, the Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis App empowers users to better understand their health and take proactive steps. In a time when digital health tools are more essential than ever, this app offers a reliable, student-built solution for the modern world.</p>
